This file primarily, contains instructions to the person(s) who shall be making a XalanJ release
for distribution, along with the instructions about how to test the release before recommending
the release for distribution.

(1) Steps to build the XalanJ release

1) Do a git clone, of the relevant XalanJ dev branch, as following :
git clone --single-branch --branch xalan-j_2_7_1_maint https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/xalan-java.git xalan-java.
Assuming that, this clone goes into the folder xalan-java.

2) Set JAVA_HOME environment variable

3) Run the command, "build fulldist" from folder xalan-java. This
shall produce the following jars, relevant for testing the XalanJ
build : xalan.jar, serializer.jar. [1]

(2) Steps to run the XalanJ tests, on this XalanJ release

1) From the XalanJ tests repos
https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/xalan-test.git, clone the 'master'
branch. Assuming that, this clone goes into the folder xalan-test.

2) Set JAVA_HOME environment variable

3) Run the command "build jar" from folder xalan-test. This produces
the file testxsl.jar within folder xalan-test/java/build.

4) Create a folder xalanjrelease_jardir somewhere on file system.
Copy the jar testxsl.jar produced within the previous step, to the folder 
xalanjrelease_jardir. Copy the jars xalan.jar, serializer.jar [1] to this 
folder. From the folder xalan-java/lib/endorsed, copy jars xercesImpl.jar, 
xml-apis.jar to the folder xalanjrelease_jardir. Copy the jar Tidy.jar 
from folder xalan-test/tools to the folder xalanjrelease_jardir. Now 
the folder xalanjrelease_jardir, has the XalanJ jar xalan.jar that 
needs to be tested, and all the supporting jars.

5) Set JARDIR environment variable, pointing to folder "xalanjrelease_jardir".

6) Run the necessary XalanJ tests as follows,

build smoketest

build smoketest.xsltc

build smoketest.dev

The output of above commands, respectively should be,
smoketest-pass:
     [echo]  [minitest] CONGRATULATIONS! The Smoketest passed!

smoketest.xsltc-pass:
     [echo]  [minitest] CONGRATULATIONS! The Smoketest passed!

smoketest-pass:
     [echo]  [minitest] CONGRATULATIONS! The Smoketest passed!
