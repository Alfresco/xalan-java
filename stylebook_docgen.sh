# Stylebook execution extracted from old Ant build
# Some of the Xalan (especially xsltc) documentation was written in
# stylebook. It isn't clear that keeping it as source and rendering
# it at buildtime, rather than checking in the generated files, is
# actually a win -- not least because those files are probably pretty
# far out of date at this point.
#
# This, or something equivalent, should be being invoked as part of our
# maven "site" build.
